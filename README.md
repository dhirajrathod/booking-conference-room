Problem: Booking conference room

Your office is having two conference room. You have been assigned a task to automate scheduling based on the request.
At the end of the day, you get all list of request for tomorrow and with title & time for the session.
Conference room can be used only between 9-12 & 1-5.
* Title can have multiple schedule with the same name.
* No talk title has numbers in it.
* All talk lengths are in minutes (not hours)
* Presenters will be very punctual; there needs to be no gap between sessions.
You can reject session which you canâ€™t scheduled due to time constraint.
